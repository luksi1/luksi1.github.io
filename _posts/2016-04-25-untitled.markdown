title: Add/Increase Oracle redo logs

From time to time, I've needed to increase the size of the redo logs to increase the amount of time log switches were occurring.

You may notice that your redo log sequence is increasing too frequently.
 
View your current logs.

<pre>SQL&gt; select a.group#, a.member, b.bytes from v$logfile a, v$log b  where a.group#=b.group#;</pre>

<br>And then create at least 3 redo logs that reflect these logs. Use the next group number available.</br>

<pre>SQL&gt; ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE GROUP 7 ('/opt/oracle/app/oracle/oradata/mydb/redo07.log') SIZE 2048M;
SQL&gt; ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE GROUP 8 ('/opt/oracle/app/oracle/oradata/mydb/redo05.log') SIZE 2048M;
SQL&gt; ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE GROUP 9 ('/opt/oracle/app/oracle/oradata/mydb/redo06.log') SIZE 2048M;</pre>

You'll probably also want to drop your old redo log groups which were too small.

<pre>SQL&gt; SELECT GROUP#, ARCHIVED, STATUS FROM V$LOG;

    GROUP# ARC STATUS
---------- --- ----------------
         4 NO  ACTIVE
         5 NO  ACTIVE
         6 NO  CURRENT
         7 YES UNUSED
         8 YES UNUSED
         9 YES UNUSED

6 rows selected.</pre>

<br>Switch your log files until your old log files are "inactive".</br>

<pre>SQL&gt; alter system switch logfile;

System altered.

SQL&gt;  SELECT GROUP#, ARCHIVED, STATUS FROM V$LOG;

    GROUP# ARC STATUS
---------- --- ----------------
<strong>         5 NO  INACTIVE</strong>
<strong>         6 NO  INACTIVE</strong>
         7 NO  ACTIVE
         8 NO  CURRENT
         9 YES UNUSED

SQL&gt; ALTER DATABASE DROP LOGFILE GROUP 5;

Database altered.

SQL&gt; ALTER DATABASE DROP LOGFILE GROUP 6;

Database altered.

SQL&gt; SELECT GROUP#, ARCHIVED, STATUS FROM V$LOG;

    GROUP# ARC STATUS
---------- --- ----------------
         7 NO  ACTIVE
         8 NO  CURRENT
         9 YES UNUSED</pre>
