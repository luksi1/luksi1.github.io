Hi. My name is Luke Simmons. I'm an American expat raising three kids with my wife in Gothenburg, Sweden. I have a passion for the forest, chantarells, <a http="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_(Sweden)">fika</a>, and programming in the operations sphere. Puppet, Docker, and Ubuntu is the sauce. Perl, Python, Java, C#, PowerShell, Ruby, and Bash is the wisp. 

I've worked in a variety of rolls at Sweden's largest healthcare provider, Västra Götalandsregionen, over the past 10 years. Unix architect. Scrummaster. Database Administrator. Currently I work as an Ops programmer, focusing on ESB solutions.
